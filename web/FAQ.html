    <p class = "question">Q: How do I reset to the default settings?</p>
    <p class = "answer">A: To reset to the default settings, refresh the web page. This will also reset the petri dish and the graph, so be sure to download your data before doing so.</p>

    <br>

    <p class = "question">Q: I changed some settings, but I didn't see any difference in the petri dish. What went wrong?</p>
    <p class = "answer">A: Some small changes in settings may not result in visible changes in the behavior of the system. Make sure you push reset after changing the settings and before pushing start for your changes to take effect.</p>

    <br>

    <p class = "question">Q: How does the reproduction of hosts work?</p>
    <p class = "answer">A: After hosts collect enough resources, they will be allowed to reproduce. The interaction value of their offspring will be their parents, plus or minus some mutation value.</p>

    <br>

    <p class = "question">Q: Why do some of the hosts not have a symbiont?</p>
    <p class = "answer">A: Not all hosts have to be infected! Any host without a circle has just not been infected yet.</p>

    <br>

    <p class = "question">Q: How long should it take for parasitism to evolve?</p>
    <p class = "answer">A: This is very dependent on the settings that you use, but it could evolve in as few as 100 updates.</p>

    <br>

    <p class = "question">Q: How do I save the graphs and data?</p>
    <p class = "answer">A: By right clicking on the graphs, you will be able to save them as a .png. To download the raw data, click the download button found at the bottom of the "Data Collection" dropdown.</p>

    <br>

    <p class = "question">Q: What can I do with the raw data? </p>
    <p class = "answer">A: You can perform further statistical analyses! We recommend R/RStudio, and pre-made R-scripts for Symbulation data can be found
    <a href ="https://github.com/anyaevostinar/SymbulationEmp/tree/main/stats_scripts">here</a>.</p>

    <br>

    <p class = "question">Q: Where can I find more information about Symbulation?</p>
    <p class = "answer">A: You can find more information about Symbulation <a href = "https://symbulation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">here</a>.</p>

    <br>

    <p class = "question">Q: What types of things can Symbulation be used for?</p>
    <p class = "answer">A: Symbulation can be used to investigate and model all sorts of symbiotic relationships. Some recent Symbulation projects have investigated the evolution of endosymbiosis, and bacteriophage behavior. You can read more <a href = "https://symbulation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/projects/index.html">here</a>.</p>
