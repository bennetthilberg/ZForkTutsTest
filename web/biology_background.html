<p> Symbiosis is a close and sustained relationship that occurs between two different species. Symbiotic relationships can either be <strong>mutualistic</strong>, where there is a net fitness benefit provided to both parties, or <strong>antagonistic</strong>, where there is a net fitness benefit conferred to only one party. Typically, in an antagonistic symbiosis, the symbiont (smaller organism) does harm to the host (larger organism) by siphoning its resources or feeding on the host itself. 
	Symbionts spread through a population through <strong>horizontal</strong> or <strong>vertical transmission</strong>, the former being when a symbiont is spread between two members of a population that do not have a parent-progeny relationship, and the latter being when a symbiont is spread from parent to offspring. A combination of high rates of horizontal transmission and low rates of vertical transmission favors the evolution of antagonistic relationships as the fate of a parasite is not intrinsically tied to the health of a host. 
 	An example of a mutualistic symbiotic relationship is between humans and our microbiome. Our microbiomes help us digest food, boost our immune system, and synthesize important vitamins. In turn, we provide them with food and a safe place to live. At birth, we are colonized by our motherâ€™s microbiomes when exiting the vaginal canal. This is an example of vertical transmission. 
An example of an antagonistic symbiotic relationship is between mammals/birds and ticks. Ticks siphon blood from their host while providing no benefit in return. Ticks are an example of a symbiont that is horizontally transmitted.
